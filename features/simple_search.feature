Feature: Search for contributions to legislation or candidate
  As a voter
  So that I can find one particular issue or person and all relevant material 
  I want a search bar that lets me find what Iâ€™m looking for


  Background:
    Given I am on the home page
    Given the following contributions exist:
    | donor             | recipient       |
    | Varun Pai         | Nancy Pelosi    | 
    | Ayushi Samaddar   | Ronald Reagan   | 
    | Praneet Wadge     | Ronald Reagan   |
    | Praneet Wadge     | Jerry Brown     |
    | Jeanne Buell      | Nancy Pelosi    |
    | J.A Buell         | Nancy Pelosi    |

  Scenario: Search for particular donor and specific politician (with disambiguation)
    When I fill in "Donor" with "Buell"
    And I fill in "Recipient" with "Nancy Pelosi"
    And I press "Search" 
    Then I should see the results page
    And I should see "Displaying 2 selected contributors to Nancy Pelosi"
